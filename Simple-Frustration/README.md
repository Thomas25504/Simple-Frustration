# Simple Frustration Game Simulation 

## Overview

This simulation must follow the **Simple Frustration** board game rules (as defined in the Appendix). The goal is to accurately model a game session in code, with a focus on console-based output for game progression and summary reporting.

## Functional Requirements

The game must output the following information to the **console** during and after the simulation:

### 🔁 During Each Turn

1. **Current Player Info**
    - Print the name of the current player taking their turn.

2. **Dice Roll Value**
    - Display the value of the dice roll for that turn.

3. **Player Positioning**
    - Show the player's position *before* and *after* the dice roll.

4. **Turn Counter**
    - Print the running total of the number of turns taken by the current player.
